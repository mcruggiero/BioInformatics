    "Beginning Bash Scripting\n",
    "Key concepts covered: Recognizing approaches to solving problems using linux commands. Become familiar with GitHub practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals\n",
    "Preparing and downloading files. Creating a bash script that tests knowledge of linux commands. Running the script and submitting it. \n",

    "Assignment\n",
    "Story:\n",
    "\n",
    "Jane has discovered 10 motifs that are associated with radiation resistance in her colony of bacteria, R.bifella. A motif is a short, recurring sequence of DNA that is associated with gene regulation. She wants to choose the motif that occurs most frequently across the bacterial genome.   However, since these experiments are costly, she wants to pick the one that has the highest number of occurrences in the bacterial genome. Which motif should she choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "SSH into the AWS server and create a folder called week2. I will be grading out of this directory.\n",
    "Copy the motif list and the genome of the R.bifella from  /home/rbif/week2_assignment/\n",
    "Create a single bash script that does the following:\n",
    "Print out the number of occurrences for each motif that is found in the bacterial genome and output to a file called motif_count.txt\n",
    "Create a fasta file for each motif (so 10 in total) which contains all of the genes and their corresponding sequences that have that motif. Each file should be named after the motif (ie ATG.txt) and outputted to a new directory called motifs\n",
    "*Note*  Please comment your code. This should include a description of what the goal of the script is at the beginning. And then any clarifying comments for snippets of code.\n",
    "You can find an example output of the assignment in /home/rbif/week2_example_output along with how comments should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is due Tuesday, July 31 at 11:59 pm. I will mark anything modified inside your assignment directory after that time as late.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission status\n",
    "This assignment will accept submissions from Tuesday, 14 April 2020, 7:00 AM"
