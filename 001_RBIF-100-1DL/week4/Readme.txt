Welcome to week4 homework! To run the script, step by step type: 

    ./copyExomes
    ./createCrisprReady.sh
    ./identifyCrisprSite.sh
    ./editGenome.sh

into terminal or type ./runAll.sh. If you use the runAll.sh pipe, it will
delete old reports. 

About the report...I am not sure if you mean shared genes or motifs. It 
seems all genes are unique, but I will look at it tomorrow morning.
